	// TODO 1:
	// 1. Define a constructor that is public, otherwise you wont be
	//	  able to access it outside the class
	// 2. Define 2 public member variables to store x & y co-ordiinates
	//	  It is a convention that member variables have a trailing
	//    underscore. For example, someVariable_ instead of someVariable
	//	  Or some people will write it as m_someVariable but not preffered

	// The function implimentation must be in the cpp file
